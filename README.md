## Background
For many agriculture input-output companies working with rural farmers, the effective and timely disposal of the post-harvest crop residues from their constituent farmers are a concern. Typically, farmers in a hurry to clear their land will burn the residues in the open-air. This not only represents a $120 billion/year of economic waste in rural economies, but also contributes to significant air pollution and even smog in nearby cities. There exists significant opportunity and value for these companies to help farmers derive additional value from the crop residues by turning these into higher-value biofuels and biofertilizers, because the improved farmer livelihood and harvest will also benefit these companies’ financial bottom line. The main barrier today is that most crop residues are loose, wet, and bulky, therefore logistically expensive and economically unviable to be hauled from rural communities to a centralized facility where they can be turned into useful products.
Takachar developed open source small-scale, low-cost (US$20-100), portable biomass conversion unit that can be latched onto the back of tractors and even donkey carts, and that can deploy to rural farms to locally upgrade and process the low-value crop residues like coconut shells into higher-value biofuel and biofertilizer. The technology will enable agricultural input-output companies to create a closed loop trash-to-cash value chain that enhances rural livelihoods. For example, the biofertilizer that the process can produce has already been tested in Kenya among 3,500 farmers to help reverse soil degradation and improve nutrient retention, thereby improving their yields by up to 27% and net income by 50%.
